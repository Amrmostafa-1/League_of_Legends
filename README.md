# League of Legends (LoL)
Project for DATA Analytics bootcamp -Ironhack

## Description
As a long-time player of League of Legends, I've always been fascinated by the role that data plays in understanding and enhancing game performance. Traditionally, players like myself have relied on third-party websites and apps to gain insights into various game metrics. While these resources are valuable, there's something uniquely satisfying about diving into the raw data to extract actionable insights.
This project aims to do just that. It's an open invitation to explore, analyze, and interpret League of Legends data at its most fundamental level.

## What I've Accomplished So Far

### Data Cleaning and Analysis:
- **Relevance for Each Objective**: In-depth analysis of game objectives and their impact on match outcomes.
  
### Statistical Analysis:
- **Correlation Analysis**: Study of how different game variables interact and affect each other.

### Game Objectives:
- **First Objectives Analysis**: Study of the importance of securing first objectives like First Blood, First Tower, etc.
- **First Objectives Pairing Analysis**: Analysis of how different first objectives pair with each other and their collective impact.
  
### Machine Learning Models:
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Predictive model to forecast match outcomes.
- **XGBoost Model**: An advanced model offering more accurate predictions.
  
### Game Metrics:
- **Composition Analysis**: Insight into effective team compositions.
- **Pick Rate for Champions**: Rates at which different champions are chosen.
- **Ban Rate for Champions**: Rates at which different champions are banned.
- **Win Rate for Champions**: Win-loss statistics for each champion.
